### The welfare effects of mobile broadband internet: evidence from Nigeria 

This paper estimates the impacts of mobile broadband cover- age on household consumption and poverty in Nigeria, the largest economy and mobile broadband market in Africa. The analysis exploits a unique dataset that integrates three waves of a nationally representative longitudinal house- hold survey on living standards with information from Nigerian mobile operators on the deployment of mobile broadband (3G and 4G) coverage between 2010 and 2016.
