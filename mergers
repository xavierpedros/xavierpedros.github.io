#### Assessing the impact of mobile consolidation on innovation and quality: An evaluation of the Hutchison/Orange merger in Austria (2017)

*Bahia, Castells and Pedros*

This study analysis the impact of the 2012 merger between two mobile operators in Austria - Hutchison 3G Austria and Orange - on 4G network coverage and speeds. 
We do so using Difference-In-Difference and synthetic control methods, being the first study to measure the impact of a mobile merger on network quality and innovation outcomes as experienced by the consumers.

We find that, as a result of the merger, Hutchison was able to accelerate population coverage of its 4G network by 20–30 percentage points, with this taking effect after two years. Hutchison’s 4G network quality also increased significantly, with 4G download and upload speeds increasing by 7 Mbps and 3Mbps respectively, two years after the merger. We also find positive effects on the quality of the other operators in the market.
