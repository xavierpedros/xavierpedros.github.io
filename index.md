#### The welfare effects of mobile broadband internet: evidence from Nigeria (2020)

*Bahia, Castells, Cruz, Masaki, Pedros, Pfutze, Rodriguez-Castelan and Winkler*

This paper estimates the impacts of mobile broadband coverage on household consumption and poverty in Nigeria, the largest economy and mobile broadband market in Africa. The analysis exploits a unique dataset that integrates three waves of a nationally representative longitudinal household survey on living standards with information from Nigerian mobile operators on the deployment of mobile broadband (3G and 4G) coverage between 2010 and 2016. 

Difference-In-Difference estimators show that mobile broadband coverage had large and positive impacts on household consumption levels which increased over time, although at a decreasing rate. Mobile broadband coverage also reduces the proportion of households below the poverty line, driven by higher food and non-food consumption in rural households. These effects are mainly due to an increase in labor force participation and employment, particularly among women.

#### The impact of mobile technology on economic growth: global insights from 2000-2017 developments (2020)

*Bahia, Castells and Pedros*

This study considers the impacts of different mobile technologies on economic growth, as well as assesses whether mobile has an additive impact when fixed broadband is in place. Applying IV and DPD models, our results show that a 10% increase in mobile penetration raises GDP per capita by 0.59- 0.76%, over and above the impact of fixed broadband. Disentangling mobile's average impact, we find a 10% increase in 2G mobile connectivity increases GDP per capita by 0.37-0.81%, while mobile broadband generates an additional impact of 0.12-0.72%. 

The magnitude of returns on mobile infrastructure upgrades does not diminish: mobile technology's impact is statistically on par with that of fixed broadband, and mobile broadband's average impact is also aligned with that of 2G connectivity. Moreover, the analysis shows that mobile's impact increases with a country's skills and with labour and capital from the services and industry sector, meaning there are important complementarities with mobile as a general purpose technology.

#### Assessing the impact of mobile consolidation on innovation and quality: An evaluation of the Hutchison/Orange merger in Austria (2017)

*Bahia, Castells and Pedros*

This study analysis the impact of the 2012 merger between two mobile operators in Austria - Hutchison 3G Austria and Orange - on 4G network coverage and speeds. 
We do so using Difference-In-Difference and synthetic control methods, being the first study to measure the impact of a mobile merger on network quality and innovation outcomes as experienced by the consumers.

We find that, as a result of the merger, Hutchison was able to accelerate population coverage of its 4G network by 20–30 percentage points, with this taking effect after two years. Hutchison’s 4G network quality also increased significantly, with 4G download and upload speeds increasing by 7 Mbps and 3Mbps respectively, two years after the merger. We also find positive effects on the quality of the other operators in the market.
