#### The welfare effects of mobile broadband internet: evidence from Nigeria (2020)

This paper estimates the impacts of mobile broadband coverage on household consumption and poverty in Nigeria, the largest economy and mobile broadband market in Africa. The analysis exploits a unique dataset that integrates three waves of a nationally representative longitudinal household survey on living standards with information from Nigerian mobile operators on the deployment of mobile broadband (3G and 4G) coverage between 2010 and 2016. 

The estimates show that mobile broadband coverage had large and positive impacts on household consumption levels which increased over time, although at a decreasing rate. Mobile broadband coverage also reduces the proportion of households below the poverty line, driven by higher food and non-food consumption in rural households. These effects are mainly due to an increase in labor force participation and employment, particularly among women.

#### The impact of mobile technology on economic growth: global insights from 2000-2017 developments (2020)

This study considers impact of different mobile technologies on economic growth and also assesses whether mobile has an additive impact when fixed broadband is in place. Applying IV and DPD models, our results show that a 10% increase in mobile penetration raises GDP per capita by 0.59- 0.76%, over and above the impact of fixed broadband. Disentangling mobile's average impact, we find a 10% increase in 2G mobile connectivity increases GDP per capita by 0.37-0.81%, while mobile broadband generates an additional impact of 0.12-0.72%. 

The magnitude of returns on mobile infrastructure upgrades does not diminish: mobile technology's impact is statistically on par with that of fixed broadband, and mobile broadband's average impact is also aligned with that of 2G connectivity. Moreover, the analysis shows that mobile's impact increases with a country's skills and with labour and capital from the services and industry sector, meaning there are important complementarities with mobile as a general purpose technology.
