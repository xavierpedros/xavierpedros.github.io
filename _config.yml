  <b>Applied Economist</b>
  <br><br>
  Keen on quantiative methods for public policy evaluation; and on the intersections between development and public policy. My recent research has centered around ICT and digital markets, in topics of industrial organization and development economics.
  <br><br>
  MSc Economics at Université Catholique de Louvain and BSc Politics at Universitat Pompeu Fabra. I have been Economist at telecoms industry trade body GSMA (10-2015 to 09-2020).
